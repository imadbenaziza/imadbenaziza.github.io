👨🏻‍🎓I am Imad Eddine Benaziza, a telecommunications and information technology engineer, currently pursuing a Specialized Master's degree in Networks and Services at Télécom SudParis, part of the Institut Mines-Télécom. Over the past few years, I have developed my skills in cloud technologies and DevOps, gaining expertise in a variety of tools and platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform. You can find some of my documented labs in the publication section above.

Most recently, I worked as an IT Support Engineer at Icosnet, where I provided technical support for a range of services including web hosting, virtual private servers, messaging services (IceWarp), and dedicated network links. Today, I am eager to apply my knowledge and contribute to impactful devops and cloud  projects within an enterprise setting.
